# Conquers-with-JavaFX
Enhanced the game engine , added an intuitive GUI with JavaFX and a guide for new players.
This game requires an defined XML for it to work , when starting a game you can eother laod a saved game or load an legitimate XML
I have included an example XML for anyon who wishes to try the game , just load the XML in the welcome screen and you are
good to go.

# Conquers-with-JavaFX
Enhanced the game engine , added an intuitive GUI with JavaFX and a guide for new players.
This game requires an defined XML for it to work , when starting a game you can either load a saved game or load an XML FILE,
I have included an example XML for anyone who wishes to try the game. <br>
<bold> just load the XML in the welcome screen and you are good to go. </bold>
